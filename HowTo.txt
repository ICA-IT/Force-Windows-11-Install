This video will show you how to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.  This does not just include fresh installs but can be upgraded from Windows 10 as well. I upgrade a system that fails all the controversial hardware requirements. It doesn't support TPM, UEFI, or have a CPU on the approved list and it runs great.
